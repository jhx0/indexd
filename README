About
======

Indexd is a simple and secure daemon that makes it possible to send
a recursive directory listing over TCP (TLS secured).

Building
=========

Building Indexd is as simple as running:

make

The Indexd binary can be found in the build/ directory.

Configuration
==============

Create /etc/indexd and put your altered config.json there, that's it.
Don't forget to change the cert/key path and everything else that you
wan't to alter.
(Have a look at examples/config.json - the format is pretty simple)

Hint: "indexd_directory" specifies the directory to be indexed.

scripts/ holds a simple bash script to generate the required cert/key
pair for indexd.

Usage
======

Easy, just run the indexd executable and be sure to have setup the 
above mentioned config json file.

You can use pretty much anything as a client that receives data, really.
(As long as you establish a TLS connection to the given address/port.
check out the examples directory for a quick and dirty example.

...the rest is history :^) Enjoy!
